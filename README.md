### Hi there, I'm Ajay Kumar 👋(Banlore, Karnataka, India)

I'm a third-year **B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student** with a major in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. I'm passionate about building and deploying intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

### `👀 I’m interested in ...`

My interests span across the full spectrum of AI development, from foundational algorithms to deployment and optimization.

* **🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning:** I have a strong focus on image classification, object detection, and model optimization. I've worked on projects like real-time face mask detection and optimizing inference speed with **TensorRT**. I'm also fascinated by the math behind optimizers like **Adam, RMSProp, and AdaGrad**.
* **🌐 Full-Stack Web Development:** I enjoy bringing my models to life by building complete applications around them. I have experience with **Flask** for creating backends and integrating them with a user-facing frontend.
* **⚛️ Quantum Computing:** I'm exploring the next frontier of computation, including the principles of quantum gates and algorithms like **Grover's and Deutsch-Jozsa**.
* **⚙️ Core Computer Science:** I have a solid interest in the fundamentals, especially **C programming**, with a focus on pointers and memory management.
* **📸 Photography:** Outside of tech, I love exploring the world through a camera lens and have a keen interest in understanding the **exposure triangle** (Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO).

### `🌱 I’m currently learning ...`

I'm a firm believer in "learning by doing." My current focus is on:

* Building **"AI Raitha Mitra,"** a full-stack agricultural assistant app using Flask.
* Developing my **personal portfolio website** to showcase my projects and skills.
* Actively participating in **hackathons** to challenge myself and learn new technologies under pressure.

### `💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...`

I'm always open to new challenges and working with a team. I'm especially excited to collaborate on:

* **AI/ML-focused hackathons** (like the ones I've joined on Devpost!)
* Open-source **computer vision projects**.
* **Full-stack applications** that have an interesting AI or data-driven component.
